The term "Software" includes all elements of the Software, including, without limitation, data files and screen displays.

For purposes of the first sentence of this section, "use" means loading the Software into RAM and/or onto computer hard drive, as well as installation of the Software on a hard disk or other storage device, and means the uses permitted in sections 2 and 4 hereinbelow.  You agree that the Software will not be downloaded, shipped, transferred, exported or re exported into any country in violation of the United States Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) by you or anyone at your direction, and that you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize the Software in any other manner in violation of any applicable law.  The Software shall not be downloaded or otherwise exported or re exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods, or to anyone or into any country who/that are prohibited, by applicable law, from receiving such property.  In exercising your limited rights hereunder, you shall comply, at all times, with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, and statutes.  Id Software reserves all rights not granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights to Id Software's trademarks.

2. Permitted New Creations.  Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and so long as you fully comply at all times with this Agreement, Id Software grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right to create for the Software (except any Software code) your own modifications (the "New Creations") that shall operate only with the Software (but not any demo, test, or other version of the Software).  You may include within the New Creations certain textures and other images (the "Software Images") from the Software.  You shall not create any New Creations that infringe against any third-party right or that are libelous, defamatory, obscene, false, misleading, or otherwise illegal or unlawful.  You agree that the New Creations will not be downloaded, shipped, transferred, exported, or re exported into any country in violation of the United States Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) by you or anyone at your direction, and that you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize the New Creations in any other manner in violation of any applicable law.

You shall not rent, sell, lease, lend, offer on a pay-per-play basis, or otherwise commercially exploit or commercially distribute the New Creations.  You are permitted to distribute, without any cost or charge, the New Creations only to other end-users so long as such distribution is not infringing against any third-party right and otherwise is not illegal or unlawful.  As noted below, in the event you commit any breach of this Agreement, your license and this Agreement automatically shall terminate, without notice.

4. Prohibition against Cheat Programs.  Any attempt by you, either directly or indirectly, to circumvent or bypass any element of the Software to gain any advantage in multiplayer play of the Software is a material breach of this Agreement.  It is a material breach of this Agreement for you, whether directly or indirectly, to create, develop, copy, reproduce, distribute, or otherwise make any use of any software program or any modification to the Software ("Cheat Program") itself that enables or allows the user thereof to obtain an advantage or otherwise exploit another Software player or user when playing the Software against other players or users on a local area network, any other network, or on the Internet.  Hacking into the executable of the Software, modification of the Software, or any other use of the Software in connection with the creation, development, or use of any such unauthorized Cheat Program is a material breach of this Agreement.

In the event you breach this section or otherwise breach this Agreement, your license and this Agreement automatically shall terminate, without notice, and you shall have no right to play the Software against other players or make any other use of the Software.

You agree to use your best efforts to see that any user of the Software licensed hereunder, the Printed Materials or the New Creations complies with this Agreement.  You agree that you are receiving a copy of the Software and the Printed Materials by limited license only and not by sale and that the "first sale" doctrine of 17 U.S.C. § 109 does not apply to your receipt or use of the Software or the Printed Materials.  This section shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

This warranty is limited to the recording medium containing the Software as originally provided by Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND SHALL BE BINDING ON OR OBLIGATE ACTIVISION.

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas (but excluding conflicts of laws principles) and applicable United States federal law.  Except as set forth below, exclusive venue for all litigation regarding this Agreement shall be in Dallas County, Texas, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Dallas County, Texas, for any such litigation.  Exclusive venue for all litigation involving Activision, but not involving Id Software, with regard to this Agreement shall be in Los Angeles County, California, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Los Angeles, California, for any such litigation.

You agree that your unauthorized use of the Software Images, the Printed Materials, or the Software, or any part thereof, immediately and irreparably may damage Id Software such that Id Software could not be adequately compensated solely by a monetary award, and in such event, at Id Software's option, that Id Software shall be entitled to an injunctive order, in addition to all other available remedies, including a monetary award, to prohibit such unauthorized use without the necessity of Id Software posting bond or other security.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This section shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

10. United States Government Restricted Rights.  To the extent applicable, the United States Government shall have only those rights to use the Software and the Printed Materials as expressly stated and expressly limited and restricted in this Agreement, as provided in 48 C.F.R. §§ 227.7201 through 227.7204, inclusive.

11. General Provisions.  Neither this Agreement nor any part or portion hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed by you.  Id Software and Activision each may assign its respective rights under this Agreement in the assigning party's sole discretion.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable, or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby.  If any provision is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree to a modification of such provision to provide for enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Failure of Id Software or Activision to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.  IMMEDIATELY UPON YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN AND THIS AGREEMENT AUTOMATICALLY SHALL TERMINATE, WITHOUT NOTICE, AND ID SOFTWARE AND ACTIVISION MAY PURSUE ALL RELIEF AND REMEDIES AGAINST YOU THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT.
