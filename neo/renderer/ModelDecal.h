	Decals are lightweight primitives for bullet / blood marks.
	Decals with common materials will be merged together, but additional
	decals will be allocated as needed. The material should not be
	one that receives lighting, because no interactions are generated
	for these lightweight surfaces.

	FIXME:	Decals on models in portalled off areas do not get freed
			until the area becomes visible again.
