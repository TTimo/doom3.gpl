This release is also compatible with Xcode Pre 4.2:

User of Xcode 4.0 will be unable to build with the following error:

"ibtool could not strip "ASLCore.nib" because it is not a valid Interface Builder document."

You can fix the nibs with the following command:

ls | grep nib | xargs -L1 ibtool --upgrade
